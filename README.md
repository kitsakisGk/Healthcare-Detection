**Multi-Disease Detection System for Medical Imaging**

Production-ready deep learning platform for automated disease detection from medical images, currently supporting pneumonia classification with plans for additional diagnostic capabilities.

## Overview

This project provides AI-powered diagnostic assistance for healthcare professionals using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The system is designed for clinical deployment with a focus on accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

## Current Capabilities

### Pneumonia Detection (4-Class Classification)
- **NORMAL**: Healthy chest X-rays
- **BACTERIAL**: Bacterial pneumonia infection
- **VIRAL**: Viral pneumonia infection
- **COVID-19**: COVID-19 pneumonia

**Performance**: 99.14% F1 Score (Ensemble Model)

## Features

- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combines EfficientNet-B3, ResNet152, and DenseNet201
- **Explainable AI**: Grad-CAM visualization showing model decision areas
- **Clinical-Ready Interface**: Streamlit web application for easy deployment
- **Production Deployment**: Docker support and Hugging Face Spaces integration
- **Comprehensive Training**: Google Colab notebooks for GPU-accelerated training
